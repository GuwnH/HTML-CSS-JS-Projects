          <p class="summary">Frankie Edgar is an underrated fighter only known by hardcore MMA fans. During his lightweight career, he was vastly undersized and stated that he did not cut weight. Meaning that his weigh in weight was the same as his cage weight and he was fighting people who were likely 170-185lbs or 15-30lbs heavier than him. He was also 5'6 and the shortest man in the division and easily the smallest overall. Yet despite this, he was able to win fights against larger legends and become a champion. It wasn't until he was past his prime that he was fighting in weight classes that he wasn't undersized in. </p>
